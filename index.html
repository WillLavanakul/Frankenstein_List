                <h2>1. ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES</h2>
                    <img style="height: 30%;width: 30%;" src="https://media.tenor.com/images/a0c075e06e95a2e7568242cf4513ccc5/tenor.gif"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;font-family: open;">Frankenstein’s obsession with creating new life caused the existence of the monster, leading to the death of many. Blinded by his desire to develop something great, he did not consider the consequences of his actions and got several people killed. Abandoning the monster filled him with hatred and led to him getting revenge through the deaths of William, Justine, Henry, and Elizabeth.</h3>
                <h2>2. LOOKS CAN BE DECIEVING</h2>
                    <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%" src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qRbCld4C--/haciutpxhv3kcehhhwcr.gif"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">You can’t always judge a book by its cover. The hideousness of the monster causes people to fear him and constantly run away from him, when really he is looking for human connection and companionship in his lonely life. The innocent exterior of Frankenstein is also deceiving, as he could be considered the true monster of the novel after abandoning his creation and causing the deaths of several innocent people.</h3>
                <h2>3. HUMAN CONNECTION IS IMPORTANT</h2>
                    <img src="https://paralign.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/giphy-3.gif"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">Throughout the novel, the monster’s main goal is to seek human connection. From the early moments of its life, the monster desires the touch of its creator, but is rejected. Later, the monster wants to finally meet the cottagers that he had been observing for so long, but is driven away after they see his hideous form. Lastly, the monster desires a female companion to be created in order to gain a connection. The loneliness and rejection that the monster feels without human connection leads to the hatred and murder of many innocent people.</h3>
                <h2>4. DON'T MESS WITH THE NATURAL ORDER</h2>
                    <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%" src="https://i.imgur.com/yQ7uelN.gif?noredirect"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">Victor’s desire to create something great and go beyond the established norms of the scientific community lead him to tamper with the natural order and create something that should not have been brought into existence. The creation of new beings should not be something done by humans and should be left to nature to take care of. Life and death are not things that should be altered and things should follow the natural order. Going against the order led to a creation that felt isolated and rejected by society, causing problems in the lives of ordinary people.</h3>
                <h2>5. GIRLS DONT ALWAYS LIKE TALL GUYS</h2>
                    <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%" src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SkinnyMiserableDungbeetle-size_restricted.gif"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">Filler</h3>
                <h2>6. EXILES CAN BECOME MURDERERS</h2>
                    <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%" src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/058826ca2c017db9d8fbb7ad198017b6/tenor.gif?itemid=4059458"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">After the monster was exiled he, at first, was not mad. He evenlearned quite a bit from the rejections he faced. But in the end, he hated what the world had to offer him and hated the world. His experiences while he was pushed away turned him into the monster that others believe he is. Him becoming alienated from society was the cause for killing Victor Frankenstein's family. </h3>
                <h2>7. BE HONEST</h2>
                    <img class = "text-center" src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/9a581725be18c4deab8114dead01fd70/tenor.gif?itemid=3476521"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">At first and throughout the book, Frankenstein was not honest about his creation to his family because he thought that they would think he was crazy. This resulted in the death of Justine as he did not confess who actually killed William. Because he was not honest, he also suffered despair as he thought he was the reason for the death of his family. </h3>
                <h2>8. DON'T NEGLECT YOUR KIDS</h2>
                    <img class = "text-center" src="https://i.imgur.com/L9z1WcF.gif"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">Once Frankenstein created the monster, he was, in essence, the monster’s parent. The monster was never taken care of and felt lonely. In the end, Victor Frankenstein’s child came back with a burning vengeance against the man who brought him into the world.This caused him to seek refuge with the family that he observed later, causing the monster to turn into a murderer. </h3>
                <h2>9. SCIENCE DOESN'T SOLVE EVERYTHING</h2>
                    <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%" class = "text-center" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/plcoWBSrPvOP6/giphy.webp"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">At the beginning of the book, Frankenstein was purely interested in science. He read the literature of past scientists such as Paracelsus and seeked advice from professors at his university. He wanted to better the world by exploring the bounds that defined our universe. His interest in life after death, resurrection, and other far-fetched topics turned into the man who created a new life form. This ultimately backfired and brought ruin to him and his family. </h3>
                <h2>10. DON'T LET ANGER CONTROL YOU</h2>
                    <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%" class = "text-center" src="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/angry-dwight.gif"/>
                <h3 class = "container" style="width:500px;">Anger and neglect were most likely the two things that fueled the monster’s rampage on Frankenstein’s family. His anger came from the neglect that he received from Frankenstein and everyone that he met. The monster was only after a companion, someone he could share a life with. Regardless of his intentions after finding this companion, he was only met with disgust and violence. The monster’s anger resulted in the death of multiple people. </h3>
